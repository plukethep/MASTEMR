    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nThis short course aims to take you through the process of writing your first programs in the R statistical programming language to analyse national and international educational datasets. To do this we will be using the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE), a desktop application to support you in writing R scripts. R Studio supports your programming by flagging up errors in your code as you write it, and helping you manage your analysis environment by giving you quick access to tables, objects and graphs as you develop them. In addition, we will be looking at data analysis using the tidyverse code packages. The tidyverse is a standardised collection of supporting code that helps you read data, tidy it into a usable format, analyse it and present your findings.\nThe R programming language offers similar functionality to an application based statistical tool such as SPSS, with more of a focus on you writing code to solve your problems, rather than using prebuilt tools. R is open source, meaning that it is free to use and that lots of people have written code in R that they have shared with others. R statistical libraries are some of the most comprehensive in existence. R is popular1 in academia and industry, being used for everything from sales modelling to cancer detection.\n\n# This example shows how R can pull data directly from the internet\n# tidy it and start making graphs. All within 9 lines of code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\neducation <- read_csv(\n  \"https://barrolee.github.io/BarroLeeDataSet/BLData/BL_v3_MF.csv\")\n\neducation %>%\n  filter(agefrom == 15, ageto == 24,\n         country %in% c(\"Germany\",\"France\",\"Italy\",\"United Kingdom\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=yr_sch, colour=country)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\nWhilst it is possible to use R through menu systems and drop down tools, the focus of this course is to write your own R scripts. These are text files that will tell the computer how to go through the process of loading, cleaning, analysing and presenting data. The sequential and modular nature of these files makes it very easy to develop and test each stage separately, reuse code in the future, and share with others.\nThis booklet is written with the following sections to support you:\n\n# Code examples and questions appear like this\na <- 1 + 3\n\n[1] Code output appears like this\nCourier font indicates keyboard presses, column names, column values and function names.\n<table> Courier font within brackets describe values that can be passed to functions and that you need to define yourself. I.e. copying and pasting these code chunks verbatim won’t work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nspecifies things to note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\ngives warning messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nhighlights issues that might break your code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ngives suggestions on how to do things in a better way\n\n\n\nActivities and coding tasks look like this\n\nwhat <- \"does this\"\ncode == \"do\""
